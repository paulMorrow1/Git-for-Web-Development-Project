## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? 
Git is a free open source Version Control System.

2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? 
Again, Git is a Version Control System, while GitHub is a 'Hosting' service for Git repositories.

3. Why do we create a branch? 
We create branches so that we can work on our own independent lines of development without disrupting the source code.

4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request?
The puropse of a Pull Request is to update the local repository to a remote repository

5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on the FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main.
To switch back and forth between branches, you need to use the 'git checkout' command with a flag '-b' follwed by the name of the branch you want to switch to.


6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do?
The 'git fetch' command downloads commits and files from a remote repository into your local repo. This allows you to see what othes have been working on before integrating it into your local repository.

The 'git merge' command is used to join two or more forked histories together into a single branch.

The 'git pull' command is used to update the local version of a repository from a remote. 'git pull' will update the current working branch and updates the remote-tracking branches for all other branches.

7. What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when competing changes are made to the same line or file, or when one person edits a file and another deletes the same file, then tries to merge the two together.


8. How do you resolve a merge conflict?
Work with your group or team member to resolve what changes you want to keep, and what changes you want to get rid of.
